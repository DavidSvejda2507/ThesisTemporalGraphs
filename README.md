# Thesis Temporal Graphs

## Overview of files:

Leiden.py, LeidenConsistency.py and LeidenConsistency2.py contain the implementations of the algorithms.

GraphGenerators.py contains functions for generating the graphs.

GraphClusterers.py contains consistent interfaces to the algorithms.

GraphAnalysis.py contains functions for measuring the consistency.

GraphPlotting.py contains functions for visualising graphs.

GraphMeasuring.py contains functions for making a list of test to run, and running a single test, and also prepares sbatch files to run all of the generated orders on a cluster.

DataStorate.py contains interfaces to read and write results to files.

DataPreparation.py contains code used to prepare a rest case with real data.

Plot.py contains functions for plotting results.

TestCalculations.py contains code for validating the algorithms.

TestPlots.py contains code for plotting the validation results.
